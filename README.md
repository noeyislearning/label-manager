## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

1. **Create Label** - Easily create new label in your GitHub repository by specifying the label name, color (hex code), and description.

2. **Update Label** - Modify existing label with new name, color, or description. This helps in refining the categorization of issues and PRs without losing their historical context.

3. **Delete Label** - Remove a specific label from the repository by providing the label name.

4. **Delete All Labels** - Quickly delete all labels from the repository. A confirmation prompt is provided to ensure accidental deletions are avoided.

5. **Create Multiple Labels** - Import a list of labels from a labels.json file and automatically create them in your repository. This feature saves time when initializing projects or applying standard label sets.

6. **Generate Label Copy** - Export a copy of all labels in a repository to a JSON file. The file is automatically named with the current date and a random suffix to ensure uniqueness.

## üî® Installation

1. **Install Bun**

   Refer to [Bun's official documentation](https://bun.sh/docs) for installation instructions.

2. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/your-repo/label-manager.git
   $ cd label-manager
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```bash
   $ bun install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables. Create a `.env` file with the following content:

   ```bash
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   GITHUB_REPO_OWNER=your_repo_owner
   GITHUB_REPO_NAME=your_repo_name
   ```

   Replace `your_github_token` with a valid GitHub personal access token, `your_repo_owner` with the name of the repository owner, and `your_repo_name` with the name of the repository.

   - To get a GitHub personal access token, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## üå¥ Usage

After installing the dependencies and setting up the environment variables, you can run the tool by executing the following command:

```bash
$ bun start
```

You will be prompted with a menu of actions to choose from:

- `Create a label`: Add a single label to your repository.
- `Update a label`: Modify an existing label‚Äôs name, color, or description.
- `Delete all labels`: Remove all labels from the repository. You will be asked for confirmation before the action is executed.
- `Create multiple labels`: Load and create multiple labels from a predefined `labels.json` file.
- `Generate a copy of labels`: Export all labels from your repository to a `.json` file saved in the `copies` directory.

### Example Commands

#### Creating Multiple Labels

For bulk label creation, prepare a `labels.json` file with the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "bug",
    "color": "d73a4a",
    "description": "Issues related to bugs or defects"
  },
  {
    "name": "feature",
    "color": "a2eeef",
    "description": "New features or enhancements"
  }
]
```

Place this file in the `data/` directory and run the tool with the "Create multiple labels" option.

#### Generating a Copy of Labels

This feature will save all current labels into a file with a name in the format `MMDDYYYY<random_number>.json` in the `copies/` directory.

## üöß Future Enhancements

- [ ] Ability to delete a specific label instead of all labels.
- [ ] Update multiple labels from a file similar to bulk creation.
- [ ] Sync labels across multiple repositories for consistency.
- [ ] A confirmation prompt is displayed to prevent accidental deletions.
