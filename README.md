# Label Manager

A command-line tool designed to simplify and automate the management of GitHub & GitLab repository labels. This tool streamlines the process of creating, updating, deleting, and copying labels, making it easier to maintain organized and consistent label structures across your projects.

## Features

1. **Create Label** - Easily create new label in your GitHub & GitLab repository by specifying the label name, color (hex code), and description.

2. **Update Label** - Modify existing label with new name, color, or description. This helps in refining the categorization of issues and PRs without losing their historical context.

3. **Delete Label** - Remove a specific label from the repository by providing the label name.

4. **Delete All Labels** - Quickly delete all labels from the repository. A confirmation prompt is provided to ensure accidental deletions are avoided.

5. **Create Multiple Labels** - Import a list of labels from a labels.json file and automatically create them in your repository. This feature saves time when initializing projects or applying standard label sets.

6. **Generate Label Copy** - Export a copy of all labels in a repository to a JSON file. The file is automatically named with the current date and a random suffix to ensure uniqueness.
